AnEngine is an object oriented PHP framework, designed as a set of tools to
simplify web site development. The basic concept of the framework is "only use
what you need". That is why, most classes are designed to not depend on other
classes in the framework (unless inheritance takes place).

AnEngine is pure PHP 5, however, several functionalities used throughout the
framework limit PHP to version 5.2.0 or later. Each class that introduces
additional limitation will have it marked in both file documentation and class
documentation. When this class is used, it will throw an exception if any of
the requirements are not met.

AnEngine is completely object oriented. It is based on several concepts,
inspired by other languages:
 - All data inside AnEngine is wrapped into an object by default, allowing
   complete type-hinting of all data, individual data type methods and, ofcourse,
   custom data types, based on any of the provided classes
 - The basic AnEngine object class, the AeObject, implements magic getter and
   setter functionality, allowing you to never worry about your properties
