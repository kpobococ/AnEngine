AnEngine is an object oriented PHP framework, designed as a set of tools to
simplify web site development. The basic concept of the framework is "only use
what you need". That is why, most classes are designed to not depend on other
classes in the framework (unless inheritance takes place).

AnEngine is pure PHP 5, however, several functionalities used throughout the
framework limit PHP to version 5.2.0 or later. Each class that introduces
additional limitation will have it marked in both file documentation and class
documentation. When this class is used, it will throw an exception if any of
the requirements are not met.
